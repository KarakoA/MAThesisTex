In this thesis an algorithm to generate interaction diagrams as described by \textcite{zhang2019scenario} for Vue.js was implemented and extended with support for lists objects and objects. Futher it was also shown how the interaction diagrams can be used to automatically generate Gherkin test scenario templates

The application is able to correctly generate interaction diagrams and scenario templates, which can be used to visualize the work flow of a \gls{spa}. The scenario tempaltes can successfully be used as an aid to generate very extensive Gherkin test scenarios. 


The application can be extended by more language constructs and features such as if-else statements, nested lists, arrow functions. In order to fully capture the complexity of JavaScript it must be extended to operate directly on a compelte \gls{ast}, such as the one generated by the ESLint parser.
A proper user interface for the Gherkin templates could also be implemented or it could be integrated as a plugin into existing Cucumber tools.
