In this thesis an algorithm to generate interaction diagrams as described by \textcite{zhang2019scenario} for Vue.js was implemented and extended with support for lists, objects and partially methods with arguments. It was also shown how the interaction diagrams can be used to automatically generate Gherkin test scenario templates.

The application is able to correctly generate interaction diagrams, which can be used to visualize and better understand the workflow of a \gls{spa}.
It is also capable of producing scenario templates, which can meaningfully be used as an aid to generate very extensive Gherkin test scenarios. 

The functionally of the application can further be expanded by including more language constructs and features such as if-else statements, nested lists, arrow functions and more. In order to fully capture the complexity of JavaScript, it must operate directly on a complete \gls{ast} of the language, such as the one produced by the ESLint parser.
A proper user interface for the Gherkin templates could also be implemented as a standalone application or integrated as a plugin into existing Cucumber tools.
