Meaningful abstractions


params either NOT\_USED
or THIS and then we have THIS.X, THIS.Y etc.. doesn't change


Method: f(params) => reads: names, writes: names, calls: [{name,params}]


ref par -> 



return statements?

model as partial function?






//actual   -> calls:method2
//expected -> calls:method2, writes obj.a
def method1(){
  let obj = method2()
  obj.a = 2
}

def method2(){
  return this.}

obj
}



methods:

A -> B
B -> A


A -> return B
B -> return A

A -> 

A -> (B,C)
B -> (A,C)
C -> None

A = -B - C
B = -A - C
C = 0

A = -A -C
2A = C

A = C/2

B = C/2 -C
B = 

equation?
