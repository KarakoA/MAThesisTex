In this thesis an implementation of an n-gram based language model using the Modified Kneser-Ney smoothing algorithm with the open source Apache Spark large scale data processing engine and the open source document oriented database MongoDB will be presented. This language model will then be used to generate sentences from input sets of keywords.
