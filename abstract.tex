This thesis aims to further explore and expand on the concept of Interaction Diagrams for scenario testing of \glspl{spa} introduced by \cite{zhang2019scenario} for applications written using the Vue.js framework. Interaction Diagrams model the reading, writing and invocation relationships between HTML tags as a directed graph in order to visualize the possible work flows of the application. An approach to automatically generate this diagrams from static Vue.js source code is presented including support for simple lists and complex objects. It is also shown how the diagrams can be used in order to generate scenario templates in the Gherkin \gls{dsl}, which can be used in \gls{bdd}.
